This is just my path, not the path, and it might not be the right fit for everyone. I’m writing this as if I were talking to a close friend or my own son asking, “How do I get started in IT?” I’ll be as real and detailed as possible in hopes that something here helps you on your own journey.\nWorking in IT has been the best job I’ve ever had—hands down. It beats the Army, beats construction, and has opened doors I never thought possible. It’s given me the chance to provide a comfortable life for my family and enjoy a solid work/life balance.\nIf you’re thinking about getting into IT, I highly recommend it. I hope something in this post helps point you in the right direction.\nWhere to Start Let’s get this out of the way right now—you’re never too old to start learning IT. I’m 35, and when I started five years ago, I didn’t even know the difference between storage and memory. Now, I’d confidently say I’m one of the top performers on my team. It’s not about age—it’s about motivation, consistency, and the willingness to keep learning.\nAlright, now that we’ve got that out of the way, there are two solid starting points I’d recommend: school and certifications—ideally, a mix of both. That foundational knowledge is important. A lot of what you’ll learn early on might feel abstract or even confusing, but once you step into an enterprise environment, things will start to click. You’ll be glad you took the time to build that base.\nCommunity college is a more affordable, yet still effective route. At the end of the day, the goal is to walk away with a piece of paper that says, “I’ve got the foundational knowledge.” We’re just trying to get your foot in the door—that’s often the hardest part—and do it without piling on a bunch of student loan debt. If you’ve got the money or land a full ride, by all means, go for the four-year degree. But if not, community college is a smart, practical option that can still get you where you want to go.\nCertifications are another solid way to show employers you’ve got the foundational knowledge. The first one I recommend is the CompTIA A+. It covers the basics—hardware, software, networking, troubleshooting—and gives you a strong overall feel for the IT world. It’s a great starting point and relatively affordable.\nAfter that, there are a few other certs worth checking out:\nFortinet Network Security Expert (NSE) – This one’s completely free and gives you a nice intro to cybersecurity concepts.\nMicrosoft Certifications – Great if you’re aiming to work in environments that use Microsoft (which is most places). They’re beginner-friendly and look great on a resume.\nCompTIA Network+ and Security+ – These usually come after the A+ and give you broader knowledge in networking and cybersecurity.\n“I’ve got the piece of paper that says I have the foundational knowledge—now what?” The next step is all about getting experience. Whether it’s working for your school’s IT department, volunteering at a church, or reaching out to every company in your area asking to shadow their IT team—you need to find a way to get hands-on time in a real environment.\nThis part can be the hardest. I completely understand that you probably already have a full-time job, responsibilities, maybe even a family—I get it. But even if it’s just one hour a week, you’ve got to make it happen. It’s only temporary, and I promise you—it will pay off. You might not get paid, but you’ll be earning something just as valuable: experience. And that experience? It’ll open doors. Everything you do, no matter how small—put it on your resume. The Secret Alright, here it is—the number one factor that will determine whether or not you break into the field: you have to be hungry. You’ve got to want it.\nIf you put yourself out there—volunteering, shadowing, offering to help however you can—it shows employers that you’re serious, motivated, and not just looking to coast. IT teams will often welcome that kind of drive. Most techs and engineers are more than happy to let you shadow them, especially if you’re bringing value, even if that just means sweeping the floors and soaking up knowledge in return.\nIt’s that kind of hustle that sets you apart from the crowd.\nMy Experience As I mentioned earlier, I didn’t really start learning about computers until I was in my 30s. Sure, I grew up with them—but like most people, I mainly used them for browsing the web and gaming. It wasn’t until later in life that I got serious about IT.\nI started off by enrolling in community college and knocking out a couple of certifications along the way. As part of my degree plan, I was required to complete a two-week internship. I ended up doing that at the organization I now work for. At the end of the two weeks, the education department let me know that my internship was officially done and I could no longer stay on.\nBut here’s the thing—I was having an absolute blast. I was learning a ton and finally getting to work with a real IT team. I didn’t want to stop. So when they told me I could only continue if I volunteered, I said, “Sign me up.”\nAnd that’s what I did—for four months, clocking in around 40 hours a week (sometimes more), all unpaid. But I loved every second of it. I showed up, worked hard, stayed curious, and proved I could contribute—whether that was organizing equipment, troubleshooting small issues, or just sweeping the floors.\nAnd guess what? When a position eventually opened up, I got the job. Why? Because I had already proven myself. I was basically part of the team already. They didn’t need to train me—I was ready to hit the ground running.\nNow, I’ll be honest—my situation had a unique factor: I’m 100% service-connected, which meant I was receiving income and didn’t have to juggle a full-time job while volunteering. That definitely helped.\nBut I still believe the outcome would’ve been the same, even if I had only been able to volunteer a few hours a week. Like I’ve said throughout this post—it’s all about showing that you’re hungry and willing to learn. That’s what makes people take notice.\nWrapping Up I sincerely hope this post has given you some helpful insight and maybe even a bit of motivation to take that first step into IT. Breaking in can be tough, but it’s absolutely possible—and if my story proves anything, it’s that with the right mindset and a little hustle, you can make it happen.\nIf you’ve got questions, want to chat more, or just need a bit of guidance, feel free to reach out.\nLinkedIn is probably the best way to get in touch with me for now—I’m always happy to connect and help however I can.\n",

<p>And guess what? When a position eventually opened up, <strong>I got the job</strong>. Why? Because I had already proven myself. I was basically part of the team already. They didn’t need to train me—I was ready to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll be honest—my situation had a unique factor: I’m 100% service-connected, which meant I was receiving income and didn’t have to juggle a full-time job while volunteering. That definitely helped.</p>
<p>But I still believe the outcome would’ve been the same, even if I had only been able to volunteer a few hours a week. Like I’ve said throughout this post—it’s all about showing that you’re hungry and willing to learn. That’s what makes people take notice.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope this post has given you some helpful insight and maybe even a bit of motivation to take that first step into IT. Breaking in can be tough, but it’s absolutely possible—and if my story proves anything, it’s that with the right mindset and a little hustle, you can make it happen.</p>
