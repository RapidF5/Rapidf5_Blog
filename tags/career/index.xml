&lt;strong&gt;Just a heads-up:&lt;/strong&gt; Everything here is based on my own experience and opinions. Nothing I say should be taken as the views of my employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-goal&#34;&gt;The Goal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this article is to share how I broke into the IT field—what worked for me, what didn’t, and the lessons I learned along the way. This is just &lt;em&gt;my path, not the path&lt;/em&gt;, and it might not be the right fit for everyone. I’m writing this as if I were talking to a close friend or my own son asking, &lt;em&gt;“How do I get started in IT?”&lt;/em&gt; I’ll be as real and detailed as possible in hopes that something here helps you on your own journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
